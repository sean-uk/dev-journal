# README

The purpose of this tool is to make it easier for developers
to document important aspects of a project of theirs with human readable notes.

To be useful, the notes needs to be taggable by subject (ie; _'security'_ or _'issue-M7RVV8XY'_)
and easily filtered by subject _or date_.

It's not meant to replace a proper knowledge base,
but rather to be a low-friction way for developers to compile notes as they go along, and so encourage regular, incremental documentation (which might be later compiled into a user guide or handover document, for instance).
